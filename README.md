This is just an attempt to show the real math behind all "no risk investment" schemes. Please note that to show the persian language in terminal, you need to use Konsole:
```shell
sudo apt-get install konsole
konsole
```
In the current version you just need to run this commands on the root of the project:
```shell
conda env create -n ponzi --file env.yml
conda activate ponzi
python main.py
```
