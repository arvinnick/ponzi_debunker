# ponzi_debunker
This is just an attempt to show the real math behind all "no risk investment" schemes.
In the current version you just need to run this script on the root of the project:
```shell
conda env create -n ponzi --file env.yml
python main.py
```

Then you will get the prompts. After answering 3 questions in numerical, a graph emerges which shows how much money you will have IF the promises are true.
